What's version control?

Version Control means the ability to modify files and be able to store them somewhere in a organized manner. The benefit of versioning is that you can track
all the modifications made in the files. This makes it possible
for someone else, for example, learn all the changes in the file
and rebuild it from scratch. One command that is commonly used in
the most used software for version control is `git add`. This command
makes sure that all the changes you've made in a file are correctly
stashed to the history of changes in the file.
